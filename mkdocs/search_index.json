Double click the installation executable downloaded from github. \nLink\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Governed Metrics Service install starts and presents the Welcome screen.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3. The installer sets the default install directory as \nC:\\Program Files\\Qlik\\Sense\\EAPowertools\n.  If Qlik Sense is installed in a different drive or location, browse and specify that location.  Please click Yes to continue with the installation. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. The Statement of Support communicates how to obtain support for the Governed Metrics Service.  Click Next. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. The configuration screen for the installer allows you to set the configuration for the Governed Metrics Service REST API.  This includes the following:  \n\n\n\n\nGoverned Metrics Service Port:\n The TCP port for the Governed Metrics Service REST API.  \n\n\nQlik Sense Node hostname:\n The name of the Qlik Sense server node the Governed Metrics Service will run.  This can be a central node or a rim node, but needs to be the hostname supplied during Qlik Sense installation.  \n\n\nMetrics Library Application Name:\n The name of the application that stores the metrics definitions the Governed Metrics Service will read from to create Master Library entries.  Enter the name of the application created during the configuration steps. \n(Default: Metrics Library)\n    \n\n\nMetrics Library Custom Property Name:\n The name of the custom property containing values that will be applied to applications in a Qlik Sense site that will receive metrics definitions from the Governed Metrics Service.  Enter the name of the custom property created during the configuration steps.  \n(Default: ManagedMasterItems)\n\n\nMaster Library Source Custom Property Name:\n The name of the custom property containing values identifying applications acting as metric sources for the Metrics Library application. \n(Default: MasterLibrarySource)\n  \n\n\nMetrics Library Data Refresh Task Name:\n The Metrics Library application (name provided above) needs a refresh task so that the Governed Metrics Service may reload the Metrics Library App when updates are made to the metrics.  Enter the name of the task created during the configuration steps.  \n(Default: Reload task of Metrics Library)\n\n\n\n\nPlease take note of the values entered in the configuration screen.  App, custom property, and task names from the installation configuration will be required during QMC configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The second configuration screen handles the use of a common (friendly) hostname used to connect to Qlik Sense externally.  If a different hostname (e.g. a hostname associated with a trusted certificate) is going to be used to connect to Qlik Sense, check the check box and enter the hostname that will be used in the text box.  Click the Next button to provide references to the certificate to use this hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. If the check box on the previous screen is checked, a trusted certificate is necessary to make a secure connection to the integration with the common hostname entered.  This screen prompts for certificate file references.\nThe certificate file location box accepts PEM or PFX file certificates.  When a PEM file is selected, a subsequent box will appear requiring a key file.\n\n\nIf a pfx file is selected, a passphrase is required to open the certificate file and read the private key.\n\n\n\nClick the Next button to proceed with the installation.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n8. The installer is ready to place files on the system.  Click Install to begin the installation.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n9. Once the installer places files on the system, the installer adds the configuration information entered earlier into the tool.  Click the Next button to continue. \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n10. The Service Dispatcher message dialog explains how the Governed Metrics Service uses the Qlik Sense Service Dispatcher to run.  The Service Dispatcher services.conf file will be updated during this step.  Click Next to continue.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n11. Click the Finish button to complete the installation.\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps - Configuring the Governed Metrics Service",

Loaded data needs to conform to the specification described in the general section below.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Configuration\n\n\nImport the Governed Metrics Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Metrics Metadata to the GMA\n\n\nUpdate the GMA Data Connection\n\n\nField Definitions and Structure\n\n\nSample Source Data Table\n    \n\n\nLoading Data from a folder or database Data Connection\n    \n\n\nLoading Data using the MDI ReST Endpoint\n\n\nCreating the MDI REST Connection in the Data Load Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Configuration\n\n\n\n\nImport the Governed Metrics Application\n\n\nThe Governed Metrics Application is part of the GMS installation.  From the installation directory, navigate to the gma folder and observe the Governed Metrics App.qvf file.\n\n\nTo import the GMA app to a Qlik Sense server:\n\n\n\n\nLaunch a web browser and navigate to the QMC for the Qlik Sense site.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Apps menu item on the left side of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the import button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Choose File button and navigate to the gma folder inside the folder Governed Metrics Service is installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Governed Metrics App.qvf file and click the Import Button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Metrics Metadata to the GMA\n\n\nLoading data to the Metrics Library is the same as loading data into a standard Qlik Sense app.  There are some guidelines to follow depending on the data source metrics metadata will be loaded from.  In general, metrics metadata will be loaded from a centralized location like a database, MS Excel, or CSV file.  In the 2.0.0 release of GMS, a new method of loading data using the Qlik REST Connector makes it possible to load metrics metadata from the master library items of other apps in a Qlik Sense site.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the GMA Data Connection\n\n\nAfter importing the GMA application, it may be necessary to update the lib references in the script to point to the appropriate data connection.  Follow these steps to update data connections in an app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new browser tab and navigate to the Qlik Sense Hub.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Governed Metrics Application and proceed to the data load editor.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Metrics Library section of the load script.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the MetricsLibrary table load in the script.  Observe the entry for the data source location.  \n\n\nFROM [lib://EAPowerToolsGMS/GMS.xlsx]\n    (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Sheet1);\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow review the available data connections from the list on the right.  If there is a match for EAPowerToolsGMS then there is no update required.  If a data connection with a different name appears in the list that points to the source of Metrics Library metadata, replace the EAPowerToolsGMS in the script with the name of the connection where the source data resides.  If no connection to source data exists, proceed to create one and update the script with the new data connection name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Definitions and Structure\n\n\nThe Governed Metrics Service relies on specific field names to distribute metrics.  While the source data field names do not have to match, the field names Qlik Sense will use need to be the following: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The ID field is a numeric primary key field for metrics distributed by the GMS natively.\n\n\n\n\nUsage:\n  \n\n\nA.\n The ID field must be filled with the Qlik Sense Engine object id when importing metrics via MDI or adopting manually created Master Library items into GMS.    \n\n\nB.\n Use a unique numeric value when a new metric is delivered to apps exclusively through GMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUID\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The UID is the field the Governed Metrics Service applies to new master library items to be created or uses to detect existing master library items to make changes.  The UID can be one of two items:\n\n\n\n\nUsage:\n  \n\n\n1.\n A hardcoded value representing an existing master library item id.  For MDI and adopted master library items, this value is the same as the ID.    \n\n\n2.\n If the UID is left blank at the source, GMS will create a UID with a modified 128 bit hash composite of the MetricSubject field and ID field.  The hash has non-alphanumeric characters stripped out for support as object ids in Qlik Sense objects.  Uses the expression \nif(isnull(UID),KeepChar(Hash128(MetricSubject,ID),'$(chars)'),UID) as UID\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricSubject\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The MetricSubject MUST equal the ManagedMasterItems custom property value.  When the Governed Metrics Service reads the Metrics Library app tables, this field is used to identify which apps will receive the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricType\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n This field identifies if the metric is a dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricName\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The MetricName field contains the friendly name displayed in the Master Library for the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricDescription\n - This field contains a description for the dimension or measure.  When a user clicks on a Master Library item, the description will appear in the pop user interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricFormula\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The MetricFormula contains the dimension field name(s) or the expression to be used for the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\nUsage:\n  \n\n\nA.\n For measures, the field is a string literal of the expression without the initial equal sign.    \n\n\nB.\n For single dimensions, enter the field name the dimension will reference.  Do not square bracket field names with multiple words and spaces.    \n\n\nC.\n For calculated dimensions, the field is a string literal \nincluding\n the initial equal sign.  If using Excel as the data source, add an apostrophe before the equal sign so that Excel will treat the expression as a string literal.    \n\n\nD.\n For drilldown dimensions, enter the field names to group together as comma separated values.  Do not include square brackets surrounding field names. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricOwner\n - This field identifies who owns the metric for informational purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricTags\n - The MetricTags field is a semicolon delimited list of descriptive tags to be added to the dimension or measure Master Library item to aid search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricGrouping\n - \n(REQUIRED)\n The MetricGrouping field identifies if dimensions are single (N), or drilldown (H).  Measures are only ever single (N).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricColor\n - \nAvailable in Qlik Sense 3.2 and higher\n, the MetricColor is applicable only to measure master items.  A hex color code value (e.g. #ffffff) may be supplied in this field to set a color for a measure.  If no hex value is supplied, no color will be set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Source Data Table\n\n\nBelow is an example of the resulting table of information expected to be loaded from the data source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nUID\n\n\nMetricSubject\n\n\nMetricType\n\n\nMetricName\n\n\nMetricDescription\n\n\nMetricFormula\n\n\nMetricOwner\n\n\nMetricTags\n\n\nMetricGrouping\n\n\nMetricColor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEDSMNFH8F\n\n\nCustomer Service\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\n% Resolved in SLA\n\n\nPercentage of Tickets handled within SLA\n\n\nSum({< [Call Ctr Days to Resolve] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6'} > } [Call Ctr Call #])/sum([Call Ctr Call #])\n\n\nLinda Lee\n\n\nKey KPI;Call\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nP29OSdkE\n\n\nSales\n\n\nDimension\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nCustomer Country\n\n\nCustomer Country\n\n\nChad Johnson\n\n\nCustomer\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nL2SDNCHDJEL4ritdsR\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\nCosts\n\n\nCost Amount\n\n\nsum([Sales Costs])\n\n\nGordon Wyse\n\n\nCost\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABCD\n\n\nABCD\n\n\nSales\n\n\nDimension\n\n\nTimeDrill\n\n\nFiscal time drill down\n\n\nFiscalYear, FiscalQuarter, FiscalMonth\n\n\nSales\n\n\ntime;drill\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsales_5\n\n\nSales\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\nSumCalc\n\n\nA fake calculation\n\n\nsum(1)\n\n\nsome person\n\n\nfake;metric\n\n\nN\n\n\n#46c646\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Data from a Folder or Database Data Connection\n\n\nHere is an example of a load statement for loading metrics from an MS Excel file.\n\n\nSET chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';\n\nMetricsLibrary:\n    LOAD\n    ID,\n    if(isnull(UID),KeepChar(Hash128(MetricSubject,ID),'$(chars)'),UID) as UID,\n    MetricSubject,\n    MetricType,\n    MetricName,\n    MetricDescription,\n    MetricFormula,\n    MetricOwner,\n    MetricTags,\n    MetricGrouping,\n    MetricColor\n    FROM [lib://EAPowerToolsGMS/GMS.xlsx]\n    (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Sheet1);\n\n\n\n\nWhile all the fields are important and required, the UID field is most critical because it is the field used to identify existing metrics deployed to applications through GMS, and the value of this field will be used to generate the engine object id of new dimensions and measures added by GMS.  It may be necessary to alter this template script to identify the source field names, but it is mandatory that the destination field names reflect the values described in the \nfield definitions\n section on this page.\n\n\n\n\nLoading Data using the MDI REST Endpoint\n\n\nBeginning in GMS 2.0.0, a REST endpoint is available to reach into other Qlik Sense applications and extract the master library dimension and measure definitions.  The definitions are formatted and loaded into the Metrics Library as if they were stored in the central data store for metrics metadata.  The advantages of this capability are reuse of existing metrics stored in apps and a way to categorize master items by using an app as the storage container for definitions.  This capability is useful when no central metrics data source exists.\n\n\nThis is a completely optional section of the guide.  If Qlik Sense apps with master library dimensions and measures will be used as a source of metric metadata, please follow the steps below to set up a connection.\n\n\nIn order for the MDI capability to work, the Governed Metrics Service must be running.\n\n\nTo access the MDI REST endpoint, use the Qlik REST Connector and follow the directions below to configure a connection and identify a MasterLibrarySource application.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the MDI REST Connection in the Data Load Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on New Connection and choose Qlik REST Connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the URL for the MDI endpoint.  The endpoint url is https://%senseServerName%:%gmsPort%/masterlib/getallMDI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Data options make sure the auto detect checkbox is checked and the key generation strategy is sequential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the authentication section, set windows authentication to \nNo\n and leave the userid and password fields blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication to the REST api uses the certificates GMS is set up to use during installation.  In the Use certificate dropdown, choose installed to use a certificate installed on the windows server through certificate management, or choose From file to enter the paths for the certificate and private key files for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Pagination section, set the Pagination type to None.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the getAllMDI path, there is no need for query parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a name for the connection, test the connection and click Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the data preview window.  Click the checkbox next to root.  This will show the data fields in the preview window.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Insert script button to add the load script to the data load editor.",

In addition, the log output is streamed to the test page when the GMS is run.  \n\n\nThe Governed Metrics Service testpage does not render (connection refused or timeout)\n\n\n\n\nDescription: When browsing to the GMS test page, the test page does not render.\n\n\nCause: The GMS uses the Qlik EA Powertools Service Dispatcher to run and the service dispatcher service has not been installed.\n\n\nExplanation: On certain operating systems (I'm looking at you Windows 7 and 10) the Powertools service dispatcher does not install during the GMS installation.\n\n\n\n\nResolution: In the Utils folder of the governedmetricsservice folder is a batch file called createServiceDispatcherManual.bat.  Before running, make sure the powertools service does not exist in the services list.  Run this batch file with administrator privileges.

In the case of GMS, it may be due to having multiple notification processes for creating dimensions or measures.\n\n\nResolution: Stop and start all Qlik Sense services, then restart the Qlik EA Powertools Service Dispatcher service.
